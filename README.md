For effects，I may upload an Streamlit web later this week. 

# EasyUse：
Namely， 
1.open the touch-designer file with touchplayer,maximiser the window
(to run this td flow, azure kinect and leap motion are perfect companium, feel free to replace those two purple input in td with any other camera-ins)
2.open comfyui (I suggests using some stable and mature version or directly using the official version) and import the json file as workflow
3.download the missing models (or customise) and custom_nodes
4. share screen in comfyui workflows and set the touchplayer as target input
